# StumbleUpon_Evergreen_Classification-ML
StumbleUpon is a user curated web content search engine that recommends relevant pages to users based on their interests. Some pages that StumbleUpon recommends, such as news articles or seasonal recipes, are only relevant for a short period of time, while others retain their timeless quality and can be recommended to users long after they are seeing. In other words, a page can  be classified as "ephemeral" or "evergreen". 

Object : Build a classifier which will evaluate a large set of URLs and label them as either evergreen or ephemera
